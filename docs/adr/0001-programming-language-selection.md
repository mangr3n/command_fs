# 1. Programming Language Selection for Command-FS

Date: 2024-01-23

## Status

Superseded by new decision (2024-11-29)

### Updated Decision

We have decided to take a phased approach to implementation:

1. **Phase 1: Node.js Prototype**
   - Use Node.js for rapid prototyping
   - Leverage rich ecosystem for filesystem operations
   - Quick iteration and validation of concepts

2. **Phase 2: Production Implementation**
   - Backend: Phoenix/Elixir
   - FUSE Implementation: Node.js initially, with option to optimize critical paths later
   - Data Layer: PostgreSQL

### Rationale for Change

- Node.js provides a more straightforward path to initial FUSE implementation
- Rich ecosystem of filesystem-related packages
- Easier debugging and development workflow
- Better documentation and community support for FUSE implementations
- Allows us to validate core concepts before committing to a more complex stack

### Original Decision (Historical)

## Context

Command-FS requires a programming language that can efficiently handle:
- FUSE filesystem operations
- Command execution and process management
- System-level interactions
- Potential REST service integration

Initial implementation was done in Python for rapid prototyping. We evaluated several languages for the production implementation:

1. Rust
   - Excellent performance characteristics
   - Strong memory safety guarantees
   - Mature FUSE library support (fuse-rs)
   - Active ecosystem for system programming
   - Zero-cost abstractions

2. Zig
   - High performance potential
   - Direct C interoperability
   - Manual memory management
   - Newer ecosystem

3. Nim
   - Python-like syntax
   - Compiles to C
   - Good metaprogramming capabilities
   - Smaller community

4. Elixir/Erlang
   - Process-based architecture
   - Robust fault tolerance
   - NIFs for FUSE interface
   - Actor model for command handling

## Decision

We are leaning towards selecting Elixir as the primary implementation language for Command-FS.

## Rationale

Elixir offers unique advantages that align well with our system's requirements:
1. Process Model - BEAM VM's process isolation provides natural boundaries for command execution
2. Fault Tolerance - Supervisor trees enable robust error handling and recovery
3. Concurrency - Actor model is well-suited for handling multiple filesystem operations
4. Hot Code Reloading - Enables dynamic updates without system restarts
5. Pattern Matching - Excellent for handling diverse command outputs and file operations
6. Functional Programming - Immutable data structures reduce complexity in file handling
7. Erlang Interop - Access to mature Erlang ecosystem and NIFs for FUSE integration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Natural fit for command execution isolation
- Built-in supervision and fault tolerance
- Excellent concurrency model for handling multiple operations
- Dynamic command loading capabilities
- Pattern matching for elegant command output handling
- Rich tooling ecosystem (Mix, ExUnit, etc.)
- Strong support for distributed systems if needed

### Negative
- Need for NIFs to interface with FUSE
- Potential performance overhead compared to systems languages
- Smaller community for system-level programming
- Learning curve for functional programming paradigm

### Neutral
- Need to establish Elixir-specific development practices
- Documentation will need to be updated for Elixir implementation
- Testing strategy will leverage ExUnit

## Implementation Notes

The migration to Elixir will be phased:
1. Create NIF bindings for FUSE operations
2. Implement command supervisor tree
3. Port core functionality from Python
4. Implement new features in Elixir
5. Gradually deprecate Python codebase

## Related Decisions

- Need to design NIF interface for FUSE operations
- Need to establish supervision tree structure
- Need to determine command isolation boundaries
- Need to define GenServer interfaces for command handlers
