# Command-FS Architecture Design

## System Overview

Command-FS is a FUSE filesystem that exposes command execution through file operations. It provides a unified interface for executing commands, accessing REST endpoints, and managing system information through standard filesystem operations.

## Core Components

### 1. FUSE Interface

The FUSE interface handles the translation between filesystem operations and command execution:

- **Mount Point Management**: Handles filesystem mounting and unmounting
- **File Operations**: Translates read/write operations into command execution
- **Directory Structure**: Manages the virtual directory hierarchy
- **Permission Management**: Controls access to different command types

### 2. Command System

The command system manages the execution and lifecycle of different command types:

- **Command Registry**: Central registry for all available commands
- **Command Types**: Supports OS commands, REST endpoints, and native commands
- **Output Formatting**: Standardizes command output presentation
- **Error Handling**: Provides consistent error reporting

### 3. Caching System

Implements intelligent caching for command outputs:

- **Cache Strategy**: Time-based and access-pattern-based caching
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart invalidation based on command type
- **Memory Management**: Efficient cache storage and cleanup

## File Types

### 1. OS Command Files
- **Purpose**: Execute operating system commands
- **Behavior**: 
  - Read: Executes command and returns output
  - Write: Provides command input or arguments
- **Features**:
  - Command output formatting
  - Argument templating
  - Error capture and reporting

### 2. REST Endpoint Files
- **Purpose**: Interface with HTTP/REST services
- **Behavior**:
  - Read: Performs GET requests
  - Write: Performs POST/PUT requests
- **Features**:
  - Response formatting
  - Authentication handling
  - Error handling and retry logic

### 3. Index Files
- **Purpose**: Provide system documentation and discovery
- **Behavior**:
  - Read: Returns formatted command listing
  - Write: Not supported
- **Features**:
  - Command categorization
  - Help text generation
  - Usage examples

### 4. Native Command Files
- **Purpose**: Implement custom functionality
- **Behavior**:
  - Read/Write: Custom implementations
- **Features**:
  - Direct system integration
  - Custom data processing
  - Specialized formatting

## Security Model

### Access Control
- File permissions mirror command access levels
- Directory permissions control command discovery
- Write permissions limited to specific commands

### Command Isolation
- Separate execution contexts for commands
- Resource usage limits
- Error containment

## Error Handling

### Types of Errors
- Command execution failures
- Permission errors
- Resource constraints
- Network issues (for REST endpoints)

### Error Reporting
- Filesystem-appropriate error codes
- Detailed error messages in command output
- System logs for debugging

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Command output caching
- Directory listing caching
- Cache invalidation policies

### Resource Management
- Command execution timeouts
- Memory usage limits
- Concurrent execution limits

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Metrics
- Command execution times
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates
- Resource usage

### Logging
- Operation logs
- Error logs
- Performance metrics
- Debug information
