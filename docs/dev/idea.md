# Command-FS Project

## Project Overview
Command-FS is a FUSE filesystem that allows mounting filehandles that execute commands and return their output as file content. This creates a bridge between the file interface and command execution.

## Core Concepts
- Mount the filesystem to a directory
- Create files that represent commands
- Reading from these files executes the associated command and returns the output
- The filesystem acts as a bridge between the file interface and command execution

## Core Architecture Design
### Command Registry System
- Hierarchical configuration system using YAML
  - Global config in ~/.config/command_fs/commands.yaml
  - Local project config in ./.config/command_fs/commands.yaml
- Command configuration initialization
- Support for command categories and documentation

### File Operation Framework
- FUSE-based command handler
- Raw command output as file content
- Command output caching for performance
- Error handling and timeout mechanisms

### Implementation Strategy
### Current Implementation
- **Runtime**: Python with fusepy
  - Direct FUSE filesystem implementation
  - Simple command execution
  - Comprehensive configuration system
  - Efficient caching mechanism

### Core Features
1. Python FUSE Implementation
   - Basic FUSE operations (mount/unmount, file operations)
   - Configuration system with hierarchical loading
   - Command system with caching and error handling

2. Testing & Documentation
   - Unit tests for configuration and command systems
   - Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
   - CLI help text documentation

### Installation
- Source-based installation using Poetry
- Global installation via pip
- Command-line interface with --init support

### Future Work
- Native Implementation (Rust/Zig)
  - Low-level FUSE operations
  - Memory-safe command execution
  - Performance optimizations
- Management Interface
  - Mount/unmount management
  - Status monitoring
  - Log aggregation

## Project Goals
1. Simplicity
   - Convention over configuration
   - Clear, helpful error messages
   - Minimal external dependencies

2. Reliability
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Command timeout mechanisms
   - Robust configuration management

3. Performance
   - Command output caching
   - Efficient FUSE operations
   - Memory-safe implementation (future)
