## Current Progress
- Successfully implemented basic FUSE filesystem
- Implemented /datetime command file functionality
- Verified mount/unmount operations
- Tested file read operations
- Completed configuration system refactoring:
  - Implemented hierarchical config loading (global and local)
  - Added config initialization with default commands
  - Improved CLI interface with better help text
  - Added comprehensive test suite for config system

### Configuration System (2024-11-29)
1. Configuration Loading Order:
   - User's global config from ~/.config/command_fs/commands.yaml
   - Project local config from ./.config/command_fs/commands.yaml
   - Local config overrides global config in memory only

2. Configuration Initialization:
   - Default config packaged with application
   - Copy default config to user's global config on first use
   - Create necessary directories automatically
   - Maintain clear separation between user and project configs

3. CLI Interface:
   - Optional mount point for initialization only
   - Focus on convention over configuration
   - Clear help text and error messages
   - Support for --init flag

4. Benefits:
   - Consistent configuration across user's projects
   - Easy project-specific customization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Simplified user experience
   - No modification of global config from local projects
