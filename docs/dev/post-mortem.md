# Project Post-Mortem

## Design Decisions

### 2024-11-28
- Initialized project with basic documentation structure following AI Coding OS protocols
- Set up three core documentation files: idea.md, plan.md, and post-mortem.md

### 2024-11-28 - FUSE Implementation Decisions
- Chose Python with fusepy for FUSE implementation due to:
  - Simple API for basic filesystem operations
  - Good documentation and community support
  - Well-suited for command execution prototype
- Decided to use Poetry for dependency management
  - Ensures clean, isolated development environment
  - Provides robust package management and publishing
  - Makes project more portable and reproducible

### 2024-11-28 - Initial Implementation Attempt
- Encountered FUSE mount issues on macOS
- Error suggests possible missing macFUSE system requirement
- Need to verify macFUSE installation after reboot

### 2024-11-28 - Successful Implementation
- Successfully implemented basic FUSE filesystem with command execution
- Key implementation decisions:
  - Used subprocess.run for command execution
  - Implemented read-only filesystem for initial prototype
  - Created /datetime test file as proof of concept
- Implementation highlights:
  - Clean separation of command execution logic
  - Basic error handling for file operations
  - Successful mount/unmount functionality
  - Verified file read operations

### 2024-11-29 - Configuration System Design
- Implemented hierarchical configuration system:
  - Global config in ~/.config/command_fs/commands.yaml
  - Local project config in ./.config/command_fs/commands.yaml
  - Local config overrides global in memory only
- Added configuration initialization:
  - Default config packaged with application
  - Auto-creation of user config directories
  - Config initialization via --init flag

### 2024-11-29 - Command System Implementation
- Completed core command system features:
  - Basic command execution with timeout handling
  - Error handling for failed commands
  - Command output caching for performance
  - Raw command output as file content

### 2024-11-29 - Package Distribution
- Chose Poetry for package management:
  - Configured command-line entry point
  - Set up build process for distribution
  - Tested global installation
- Installation methods:
  - Source installation via poetry build
  - Global installation using pip

## Key Learnings

### Technical Decisions
- Python with fusepy provides excellent foundation for FUSE development
- Hierarchical config system balances global and project-specific needs
- Poetry simplifies package management and distribution
- Raw command output preferred over formatted output for flexibility

### Project Management
- Following AI Coding OS protocols for consistent project structure
- Importance of early documentation setup
- Value of comprehensive test coverage
- Benefits of clear installation documentation

### Future Considerations
- Potential native implementation in Rust/Zig for performance
- Need for dynamic config updates while mounted
- Possible management interface for monitoring
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Recommendations

### Development Process
- Continue with test-driven development approach
- Maintain clear documentation of design decisions
- Keep installation process simple and well-documented

### Technical Direction
- Consider native implementation for performance-critical components
- Explore dynamic configuration capabilities
- Focus on error handling and timeout mechanisms
- Maintain minimal external dependencies
